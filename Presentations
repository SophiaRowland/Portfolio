## All Things Open and All Things Open AI
- [ATO 2022: A Data Scientist’s and ML Engineer’s Guide to ModelOps Session](https://2022.allthingsopen.org/sessions/a-data-scientists-and-ml-engineers-guide-to-modelops/) - In a recent survey, 42% of data scientists reported that their results were not used by decision-makers. When this work goes unused, it is demotivating. Ultimately, data scientists want to apply the models they have developed to solve problems and make better decisions. Data scientists want to make an impact. But despite all this work and investment, there is still a gap between finding insights and using insights. Enter ModelOps. In this session, Sophia Rowland, Product Manager of ModelOps at SAS, will introduce ModelOps, provide steps for getting started, and walk through best practices. This session will address how to bridge the gap between finding insights and using insights to improve outcomes through improved decision-making through analytics.
- [ATO 2024:  Enforcing Trustworthy AI Standards & Best Practices in Analytical Projects](https://2024.allthingsopen.org/sessions/enforcing-trustworthy-ai-standards-best-practices-in-analytical-projects) - The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released an AI Risk Management Framework for trustworthy and responsible use of AI and analytics. NIST offers a portfolio of measurements, standards, and legal metrology to provide recommendations that ensure traceability, enable quality assurance, and harmonize documentary standards and regulatory practices. Their framework is very detailed with recommendations across four functions: govern, map, measure, and manage. In this session, we’ll discuss adopting these recommendations to ensure that analytical models don’t create disparate impact or harm. Attendees to this session will gain a greater understanding of trustworthy AI best practices as well as user roles and expectations for building responsible analytics.
- [ATO AI 2025: Responsible AI Considerations for Language Models](https://allthingsopen.ai/sessions/responsible-ai-considerations-for-language-models) - AI is being used throughout our world in the systems and tools we use every day. This also means that AI is being used irresponsibly throughout our world. Irresponsible usage of AI incurs a cost, but it is not always a financial cost. As Language Models and Generative AI adoption increases, organizations open themselves to a new set of risks. In this session, Sophia Rowland will introduce potential pitfalls of Language Model adoption and how to address those pitfalls to build AI systems more responsibly.
