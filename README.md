## The SAS Data Science Blog
1. [An Easy Button for Data Science](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2019/10/23/data-science-easy-button/) - Do you ever wish there was an easy button on data science? Do you ever think to yourself, "I want a solution that could examine the importance of missing variables, create new features, and build models with the best possible performance?" I am still looking for that easy button. However, the Data Science Pilot Action Set comes pretty close.
2. [Everything But the Kitchen Sink Feature Generation](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2019/11/06/kitchen-sink-feature-generation/) -  Using the featureMachine action, we were able to create many new features and using the selectFeatures action, we narrowed our features down into a usable number. 
3. [Automated Machine Learning Pipelines](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2019/11/21/automated-machine-learning-pipelines/) - The dsAutoMl action is all that and a bag of chips! It will explore your data, generate features, select features, create models, and autotune the hyper-parameters of those models. 
4. [SAS and R Integration for Machine Learning](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2019/12/04/sas-r-integration-machine-learning-swat/) - R first appeared in 1993 and has gained a steady and fiercely loyal fan base. But as data sets become both longer and wider, storage and processing speeds become an issue. Having spent weeks whipping an extremely wide and messy data set into shape using only R, I am so grateful for SAS Viya and not having to go through that again. SAS Viya is a cloud-enabled, in-memory analytics engine which allows for rapid analytics insights. SAS Viya utilizes the SAS Cloud Analytics Services (CAS) to perform various actions and tasks. Best of all, CAS is accessible from various interfaces including R.
5. [SASPy for Modeling](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2019/12/18/saspy-modeling/) - SAS Viya is great for coding in open source languages. Don't believe me? Then check out my previous blog on machine learning with R (and check back later for data science in Python on Viya). An area I haven't touched on yet is integrating open source and SAS 9.4. But, the wait is over! I would like to introduce SASPy, the package for building a bridge between SAS 9.4 and Python. Some of you may be saying "Well, wait SASPy is nothing new to us 9.4 natives!" Which is true. SASPy has been on GitHub since 2015. 
6. [Easier Feature Generation and New Data Science Pilot Actions](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/02/05/easierfeaturegeneration/) - In the middle of my blog series, SAS released Viya 3.5. Included in Viya 3.5 was the release of Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning (VDMML) 8.5, which includes several new Data Science Pilot features and actions. Therefore, I will go over the two new actions, the new SAS Studio task, and the new node for the visual Model Studio interface. As a result of these additions, the Data Science Pilot action set is more powerful and feature generation has just gotten even more easier and accessible!
7. [An Easy Button for Data Science in Python](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/02/12/an-easy-button-for-data-science-in-python/) - This blog will go over the Data Science Pilot Action Set from Python.
8. [Maximize model performance without maximizing effort](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/04/08/maximize-model-performance/) -  In SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning, adding hyperparameter autotuning only requires an extra line of code or a button click. While SAS searches the hyperparameter space in the background, I am free to pursue other work. Hyperparameter autotuning is now one of my favorite machine learning capabilities (right next to feature machines). Through hyperparameter autotuning, I am maximizing my model's performance without maximizing my effort. 
9. [Automated Machine Learning Vs. The Data Scientist](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/04/20/auto-ml-vs-data-scientist/) - Ever since automated machine learning has entered the scene, people are asking, "Will automated machine learning replace data scientists?" I personally don't think we need to be worried about losing our jobs any time soon. Automated machine learning is great at efficiently trying a lot of different options and can save a data scientist hours of work. The caveat is that automated machine learning cannot replace all tasks. Automated machine learning does not understand context as well as a human being. This means that it may not know to create specific features that are the norm for certain tasks. Also, automated machine learning may not know when it has created things that are irrelevant or unhelpful.
10. [Portfolio Optimization using SAS and Python](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/05/22/portfolio-optimization-sas-python/) - Analytics can be categorized into four levels: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive. Descriptive analytics explore what happened, diagnostic analytics examine why something happened, and predictive analytics imagine what will happen. Today, we will focus on the final level, prescriptive analytics, which tries to find the best possible outcome. Specifically, we will focus on using optimization to select a stock portfolio that maximizes returns while taking risk tolerance into account.
11. [Operationalizing Consumer Complaint Monitoring](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/09/25/operationalizing-consumer-complaint-monitoring/) -  The Text Investigation Framework utilizes several technologies built on SAS Viya, providing a well-integrated and open solution for operationalizing text analytics. As a follow-up to our last post, we will discuss a key application of the framework relevant to customers of all industries – monitoring customer complaints.
12. [Utilizing Text Models with Ease](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2021/04/29/utilizing-text-models-with-ease/) - As an example, I am frequently thinking about how to productionalize and operationalize text analytics. Many organizations are still focusing on operationalizing their classification and prediction models, often leaving text models as science experiments or ad hoc jobs. But with the release of SAS Viya 2020.1.4, text categories and concept models can now be deployed into production with just a few clicks and used to score data in-batch and via API! You can also now use these models in decision flows. In today’s article, let me show you how easy it is to put these models into production and utilize these models for decisioning.
