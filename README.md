## The SAS Data Science Blog
1. [An Easy Button for Data Science](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2019/10/23/data-science-easy-button/) - Do you ever wish there was an easy button on data science? Do you ever think to yourself, "I want a solution that could examine the importance of missing variables, create new features, and build models with the best possible performance?" I am still looking for that easy button. However, the Data Science Pilot Action Set comes pretty close.
2. [Everything But the Kitchen Sink Feature Generation](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2019/11/06/kitchen-sink-feature-generation/) -  Using the featureMachine action, we were able to create many new features and using the selectFeatures action, we narrowed our features down into a usable number. 
3. [Automated Machine Learning Pipelines](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2019/11/21/automated-machine-learning-pipelines/) - The dsAutoMl action is all that and a bag of chips! It will explore your data, generate features, select features, create models, and autotune the hyper-parameters of those models. 
4. [SAS and R Integration for Machine Learning](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2019/12/04/sas-r-integration-machine-learning-swat/) - R first appeared in 1993 and has gained a steady and fiercely loyal fan base. But as data sets become both longer and wider, storage and processing speeds become an issue. Having spent weeks whipping an extremely wide and messy data set into shape using only R, I am so grateful for SAS Viya and not having to go through that again. SAS Viya is a cloud-enabled, in-memory analytics engine which allows for rapid analytics insights. SAS Viya utilizes the SAS Cloud Analytics Services (CAS) to perform various actions and tasks. Best of all, CAS is accessible from various interfaces including R.
5. [SASPy for Modeling](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2019/12/18/saspy-modeling/) - SAS Viya is great for coding in open source languages. Don't believe me? Then check out my previous blog on machine learning with R (and check back later for data science in Python on Viya). An area I haven't touched on yet is integrating open source and SAS 9.4. But, the wait is over! I would like to introduce SASPy, the package for building a bridge between SAS 9.4 and Python. Some of you may be saying "Well, wait SASPy is nothing new to us 9.4 natives!" Which is true. SASPy has been on GitHub since 2015. 
6. [Easier Feature Generation and New Data Science Pilot Actions](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/02/05/easierfeaturegeneration/) - In the middle of my blog series, SAS released Viya 3.5. Included in Viya 3.5 was the release of Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning (VDMML) 8.5, which includes several new Data Science Pilot features and actions. Therefore, I will go over the two new actions, the new SAS Studio task, and the new node for the visual Model Studio interface. As a result of these additions, the Data Science Pilot action set is more powerful and feature generation has just gotten even more easier and accessible!
7. [An Easy Button for Data Science in Python](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/02/12/an-easy-button-for-data-science-in-python/) - This blog will go over the Data Science Pilot Action Set from Python.
8. [Maximize model performance without maximizing effort](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/04/08/maximize-model-performance/) -  In SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning, adding hyperparameter autotuning only requires an extra line of code or a button click. While SAS searches the hyperparameter space in the background, I am free to pursue other work. Hyperparameter autotuning is now one of my favorite machine learning capabilities (right next to feature machines). Through hyperparameter autotuning, I am maximizing my model's performance without maximizing my effort. 
9. [Automated Machine Learning Vs. The Data Scientist](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/04/20/auto-ml-vs-data-scientist/) - Ever since automated machine learning has entered the scene, people are asking, "Will automated machine learning replace data scientists?" I personally don't think we need to be worried about losing our jobs any time soon. Automated machine learning is great at efficiently trying a lot of different options and can save a data scientist hours of work. The caveat is that automated machine learning cannot replace all tasks. Automated machine learning does not understand context as well as a human being. This means that it may not know to create specific features that are the norm for certain tasks. Also, automated machine learning may not know when it has created things that are irrelevant or unhelpful.
10. [Portfolio Optimization using SAS and Python](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/05/22/portfolio-optimization-sas-python/) - Analytics can be categorized into four levels: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive. Descriptive analytics explore what happened, diagnostic analytics examine why something happened, and predictive analytics imagine what will happen. Today, we will focus on the final level, prescriptive analytics, which tries to find the best possible outcome. Specifically, we will focus on using optimization to select a stock portfolio that maximizes returns while taking risk tolerance into account.
11. [Operationalizing Consumer Complaint Monitoring](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2020/09/25/operationalizing-consumer-complaint-monitoring/) -  The Text Investigation Framework utilizes several technologies built on SAS Viya, providing a well-integrated and open solution for operationalizing text analytics. As a follow-up to our last post, we will discuss a key application of the framework relevant to customers of all industries – monitoring customer complaints.
12. [Utilizing Text Models with Ease](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2021/04/29/utilizing-text-models-with-ease/) - As an example, I am frequently thinking about how to productionalize and operationalize text analytics. Many organizations are still focusing on operationalizing their classification and prediction models, often leaving text models as science experiments or ad hoc jobs. But with the release of SAS Viya 2020.1.4, text categories and concept models can now be deployed into production with just a few clicks and used to score data in-batch and via API! You can also now use these models in decision flows. In today’s article, let me show you how easy it is to put these models into production and utilize these models for decisioning.
13. [SAS and Microsoft Certifications for Data Scientists](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2021/06/11/sas-and-microsoft-certifications-for-data-scientists/) -  I’ve had the opportunity to earn several SAS and Microsoft certifications, so in today’s article, I want to share my thoughts around each one to help you decide which is right for you!

## SAS Communities 
1. [Building Control Charts for SAS Visual Analytics on Viya](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Building-Control-Charts-for-SAS-Visual-Analytics-on-Viya/ta-p/633643) - Out-of-the-box, SAS Visual Analytics on Viya does not include a control chart object. In addition, the reference lines in the time series object are static – they will not dynamically change as the data changes. But that is not a problem for us! To create a dynamic control chart, meaning a chart that changes the average, UCL, and LCL lines, based on a rolling date period, we will build a custom graph, make calculated items, and filter the chart by date. In-depth step-by-step instructions on creating controls charts in SAS Visual Analytics on Viya are below!
2. [Building Performance Monitoring Processes in SAS Workflow Manager](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Building-Performance-Monitoring-Processes-in-SAS-Workflow/ta-p/685836) - SAS Workflow Manager is a tool on SAS Viya that allows users to build out defined processes for their analytical lifecycle. These workflows consist of a defined series of tasks. SAS Workflow Manager can systemically route tasks requiring manual intervention while automatically triggering system tasks and alerts. This allows teams to embed manual checks-and-balances while automating where they can. The processes built into SAS Workflow Manager can be fully customized to fit your business procedures. In this post, we will start by understanding the components of SAS Workflow Manager before moving on to create a performance monitoring workflow.
3.

But discovering the insights buried in text to build better decisions can often be a manual process. With the right tools, this process can be completely automated and even API-enabled.  I propose a solution based on SAS Intelligent Decisioning that can take text from an API call, process the text using a model built in SAS Visual Text Analytics,  and return a decision based on the results of the text model.
6. [Using SAS Viya ASTORE Score Code in SAS 9.4](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Using-SAS-Viya-ASTORE-Score-Code-in-SAS-9-4/ta-p/679269) - This solution is aimed at organizations that want to take models built within SAS Viya and use SAS 9.4 to execute scoring. SAS Viya and SAS 9.4 can act as complements to form one analytical platform. These two can interoperate in a variety of ways, but today we will focus on taking ASTORE Score Code from Viya to run in SAS 9.4.
7. [Using SAS Viya Data Step Score Code in SAS 9.4](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Using-SAS-Viya-Data-Step-Score-Code-in-SAS-9-4/ta-p/677520) - SAS Viya and SAS 9.4 interoperate in a variety of ways.
